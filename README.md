Worked way too long on this considering I'll be coming back to it later. At one point I woke up from dreaming about it and wrote the first version of if statements that calculate the win lose parameters. That all got thrown out later and I came up with "and" "or" statements. I learned to use the return function properly. I learned loops, and I learned console styling. I do not understand arrays yet and I see that it could improve my code.
